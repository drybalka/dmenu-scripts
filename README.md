# dmenu-scripts

A collection of useful dmenu scripts:
- `dmenu-run-recent` - opens recent and most used programs in dmenu and allows to run them using custom command (sample customcommands file attached
- `dmenu-session` - X-session manager
- `dmenu-locate` - runs locate command and prints result in dmenu
- `dmenu-pass` - allows sudo authorization through dmenu
- `dmenu-nordvpn` - manages nordvpn connection with dmenu

All scripts are customized to use a config file (similar to the one here) located in `$DMENU_CONFIG`, by default "$HOME/.config/dmenu/config".
